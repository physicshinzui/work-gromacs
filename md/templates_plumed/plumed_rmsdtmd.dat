# The followig columns are in the COLVER output file.
#
# bias: the instantaneous value of the bias potential
# work: the total work performed changing this restraint
# force2: the instantaneous value of the squared force due to this bias potential
# _cntr: one or multiple instances of this quantity can be referenced elsewhere in the input file.
#        these quantities will named with the arguments of the bias followed by the character string _cntr.
#        These quantities give the instantaneous position of the center of the harmonic potential.
# _work: one or multiple instances of this quantity can be referenced elsewhere in the input file.
#        These quantities will named with the arguments of the bias followed by the character string _work.
#        These quantities tell the user how much work has been done by the potential in dragging the system along the various colvar axis.
# _kappa: one or multiple instances of this quantity can be referenced elsewhere in the input file.
#         These quantities will named with the arguments of the bias followed by the character string _kappa.
#         These quantities tell the user the time dependent value of kappa.
